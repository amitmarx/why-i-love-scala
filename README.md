# why-i-love-scala


## What's here
The code here is going to be in scala (obviously), and most of the examples are going to show   
some FP concepts implemented by my own, or some cool scala tricks.

## Why I've opened this repo
Some of the most enjoyable code I've written are scratches.  
Those toy examples were either a result of a need (refactorying, POC's, ect),  
or an attempt to play with some concepts I've watched on videos or articles.  

After few times I found myself remember that I've learnt something cool but couldn't recall what it was,  
and few times I wanted to share those concepts in concice example,  
I've decided to create this repo and upload every time I think I've created something cool.
